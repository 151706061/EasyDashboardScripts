# EasyDashboardDefaults.cmake


# This file is included *before* EasyDashboardVariables.cmake sets most of
# the ED_* variables to default values. It is intended as a hook for you to
# set ED_* variables to machine/site-specific default values. It is optional.
# If you do not have this file or you do not set anything in this file,
# reasonable default values are used.


# Set ED_contact to your name, your email address or some other value that
# uniquely identifies you as the person responsible for submitting dashboards
# from this machine. Include enough context that human readers of this
# variable value can tell who you are.
#
SET(ED_contact "Please set ED_contact in '${CMAKE_CURRENT_LIST_FILE}'")


# Set this variable to choose the CMake generator you would like to use by
# default, when a specific generator is not given as an EasyDashboard script
# argument. Search for ED_gen_default in EasyDashboardVariables.cmake to see
# the available choices. Not all choices work on all platforms.
#
SET(ED_gen_default "@ED_gen_default@")


# Set this variable to name your machine/site for dashboard submissions.
#
SET(ED_site "@ED_site@")
